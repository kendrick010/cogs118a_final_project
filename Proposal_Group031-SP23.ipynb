    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "In this day and age, electric vehicles (EVs) are taking over the streets due to its outweighing benefits in being environmentally friendly, efficient, and gas-free. However, a significant barrier that preventing most households from switching to EVs is the convenience of charging stations. Thus, for our project we would like to create a model that predicts the availability of charging stations given inputs, such as maximum mileage, starting location and destination, and EV charging brands, to reassure the difficulties in road trip planning with EVs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specific datasets we would employ for our model would be geographic and technical datasets of charging stations in the United States. All charging station observations will be trained using classification algorithms that would determine the optimal charging station for a test point, based on maximum mileage, starting location and destination, and EV charging brands. Metrics, such as precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC curve, will be used to measure the performance of the algorithms and models."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "With the explosive market growth for EVs and charging systemâ€™s development, driving electric has become a popular trend. However, a huge leap that prevents everyone from buying an EV would be its arised difficulties, specifically vehicle mileage restrictions, charging station density distribution between suburbs and cities, and battery capacity<a name=\"garling\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#garlingnote). Due to these issues, most households may prefer owning a gas vehicle for contemporary use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Relevant studies have addressed these difficulties by predicting the availability of charging stations and vehicle to home (V2H) services. Models used to optimize electricity bills have suggested that the less an EV is used for travelling, the greater its availability to participate in V2H services <a name=\"dominguez\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#domingueznote)."

    "\n",
    "In the scope of this project, we would like to predict the availability of vehicle charging stations from inputs, such as maximum mileage, starting location and destination, and EV charging brands. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is quantifiable and measurable in the sense of converting the distance of the nearest and optimal charging station into probability estimates from classification algorithms. Some charging sites can vary its charging time and cost; in the scenario the model yields multiple charging stations, we could rely on a decision tree model to greedily pick the optimal station. Metrics, such as precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC curve, will be used to measure the performance of the algorithms and models. Road trip planning is a recurring in many lives; therefore, we would like to generalize our solution for all EV drivers. Since the dataset we are using continually updates fueling station locations in the United States, our solution would generalize over time as well."

    "\n",
    "Our proposed solution to the problem is a model to assist road trip planning for EV drivers. We plan to utilize charging station observations from our dataset and estimate the distance between a starting location, ending location, and each other charging sites. The model will take inputs, such as maximum mileage, starting location and destination, and EV charging brands, to output a score of the relative available charging stations. As an potential feature, the model would output a map of an optimal route for a trip from starting location and destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this application, classification algorithms, such as DBSCAN and logistic regression, would convert distances of the nearest and optimal charging station into probability estimates. Our methodologies for obtaining these distances would be through the [Map Request API](https://developer.mapquest.com/) for routes. Some charging sites can vary its charging time and cost; in the scenario the model yields multiple charging stations, we could rely on a decision tree model to greedily pick the optimal station."
